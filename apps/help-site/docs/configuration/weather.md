# Weather

Weather is a **built-in** chat capability—not an installable integration. When enabled, the `getWeather` tool is available in **every** chat session automatically. You do not select it in the integration picker.

Forecasts come from **[Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/)** (global coverage). Place names are turned into coordinates with a geocoding service (Nominatim by default).

## How it works

When the model calls `getWeather`, Toby:

1. Resolves the place (from a name, latitude/longitude, or your default location).
2. Fetches forecast data for the requested date (or today).
3. Returns structured fields such as temperature range, precipitation, wind, and a short weather description.

The free Open-Meteo tier needs **no API key**. If you have a paid/commercial Open-Meteo subscription, you can paste your API key so Toby uses the customer endpoint.

## Configure

1. Open **Toby.app → Settings → Weather**.
2. Set **Enabled** to **On**.
3. Optionally set:

| Setting | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Default location** | Used when you ask about “the weather” without naming a place |
| **Temperature unit** | Celsius or Fahrenheit |
| **Open-Meteo API key** | Optional paid/customer key for higher limits / commercial use |

## Using weather in chat

Once enabled, ask Toby about the weather. Prefer natural questions:

### Example prompts

- “What’s the weather in Seattle tomorrow?”
- “Will it rain in Tokyo this weekend?”
- “Hourly forecast for 37.77, -122.42 on Friday”
- “How hot will it be in London next Tuesday?”

Toby should use **`getWeather`** for these instead of a general web search when Weather is on.

For “weather near me” / “here” without a place name, Toby may call
**`getMyLocation`** first (see [Location](./location)), then pass coordinates
into `getWeather`.
